Introduction
------------
Some marketing-ish description of what MSL is and why Kenzan is working on it

Tools
-----

API Documentation and Code Generation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Swagger open-source tool (http://github.com/swagger-api) allows the team to unify the documentation of the API with the generation of client and server code. This assures that the documentation is always in sync with the code. Further, it allows the team to
publish the documentation in various formats. 

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The AsciiDoc open-source tool (http://asciidoc.org/) allows the team to produce documentation that can then be formatted and published in a variety of formats. 

Client

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~
[red]#TBA#: a diagram of the client architecture

Language(s) and Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AngularJS
^^^^^^^^^
This project is a single page app built on the AngularJS framework (https://angularjs.org/). AngularJS is a flexible toolset that works well with other libraries.

Sass
^^^^
The project uses Sass (http://sass-lang.com), a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. This project uses the SCSS syntax.

Material Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the root of this CSS and Angular architecture lies Google's Material Design (http://www.getmdl.io/). We are using the Angular Material (https://material.angularjs.org/) version of Material Design to leverage built in Angular components.

KSS Styleguide Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
KSS (http://warpspire.com/kss/styleguides/) is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as Sass or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).

ES2015
^^^^^^
This project leverages new JavaScript features available in ES2015. Babel (https://babeljs.io/) is used to transpile the JavaScript.

Webpack
^^^^^^^
Webpack (https://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundler. It is used to produce static assets from modules with dependencies.


Server
------

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~
[red]#TBA#: a diagram of the client architecture

Language(s) and Frameworks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The back-end server is written in Java - Enterprise Edition 1.8, to be exact. Communication between client and server is performed using a RESTful web service over HTTP. The REST code stubs, generated by Swagger (http://github.com/swagger-api), use JaxRs annotations (http://jax-rs-spec.java.net). Java's Jersey library (http://jersey.java.net) is used as the implementation of the JaxRs API. JUnit is used as out unit testing framework.

Portions of the Netflix OSS stack are used to provide cloud services. At its foundation, the server is based on Karyon (http://github.com/Netflix/karyon) - this enables the use of other useful Netflix OSS tools. For example, Archaius (http://github.com/Netflix/archaius) is used as the configuration manager allowing the service to react to changes in configuration parameters dynamically, and EVCache (http://github.com/Netflix/EVCache) is used as the highly available, distributed memory cache.

All data is persisted using Apache's Cassandra (http://cassandra.apache.org). Cassandra is a highly available, scalable NoSQL database. The DataStax Java driver and row->POJO mapper (http://datastax.github.io/java-driver) are used to interface the Java code with the Cassandra database.

That is a *LOT* of information. Let's summarize...

Artwork
~~~~~~~
Album, artist and song artwork is being retrieved from MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org), "an open music encyclopedia that collects music metadata and makes it available to the public." The Million Song Library data contains an artist's MusicBrainz ID (artist_mbid). As part of the data import process, this identifier is used via the MusicBrainz REST API to retrieve the links to artwork.

MusicBrainz REST API

Parsing and Using MusicBrainz Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As can be seen in the example REST response, above, multiple "releases" (AKA albums) can be returned for the requested artist. The data import code will review the available releases/albums for the artist and select album art using the following algorithm:

. Consider only those releases/albums whose <title> matches (case-INsensitively) the name of the album from the MSL data
. Consider only those release/albums with <cover-art-archive><front>=true
. Give preference to possibly multiple candidates based on <packaging> in this order:
.. "Jewel Case" (this is a CD)
.. "Cardboard/Paper Sleeve" (this is an LP)
.. "Cassette Case" (this is a cassette, obviously)
.. anything else

If a particular piece of art is NOT available, the image link field in the database will be left blank/null. If artwork is available, then the data import process will retrieve the image URL from the Cover Art Archive (http://coverartarchive.org) REST API (using CoverArtArchiveClient) and write it into the database.

CoverArtArchiveClient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The CoverArtArchiveClient class from http://github.com/lastfm/coverartarchive-api will be used to retrieve the image URL using the release MBID.

CoverArtArchive Code Snippet
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[source,java]
CoverArtArchiveClient client = new DefaultCoverArtArchiveClient();
UUID releaseMbid = UUID.fromString(<MusicBrainz release mbid>);
CoverArt coverArt = client.getByMbid(releaseMbid);
if (coverArt != null) {
    for (CoverArtImage coverArtImage : coverArt.getImages()) {
        if(coverArtImage.isFront()) {
            String imageUrl = coverArtImage.getSmallThumbnail()
            if (null == imageUrl) {
                coverArtImage.getLargeThumbnailUrl()); 
            }
            if (null == imageUrl) {
                coverArtImage.getImageUrl()); 
            }
        }
    }
}

Parsing and Using CoverArtArchive Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As can be seen in the code snippet, above, multiple images can be returned for the requested release/album. The data import code will review the available images for the release/album and select the image URL using the following algorithm:

. Consider only those images where isFront() == true
. Give preference to possibly multiple URLs in this order:
.. small thumbnail
.. large thumbnail
.. image (this is the high resolution image)

If, based on this algorithm, a particular piece of art is NOT available, the image link field in the database will be left blank/null.

"Image Unavailable" Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When preparing to send a link to artwork in response to a request to our server, if the image link URL from the database is blank/null, the server will insert a URL, defined as a configuration parameter, that points to an "artwork unavailable" image on the pages server. Three "artwork unavailable" images (one each for: album, artist, and song) will exist for http retrieval from the pages server.

Database
~~~~~~~~
There is so much detail to include here, it deserves link:Database.adoc [its own page].
