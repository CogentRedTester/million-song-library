Language(s) and Frameworks
--------------------------
AngularJS
~~~~~~~~~
This project is a single page app built on the AngularJS framework (https://angularjs.org/). AngularJS is a flexible toolset that works well with other libraries.

Sass
~~~~
The project uses Sass (http://sass-lang.com), a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. This project uses the SCSS syntax.

Material Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the root of this CSS and Angular architecture lies Google's Material Design (http://www.getmdl.io/). We are using the Angular Material (https://material.angularjs.org/) version of Material Design to leverage built in Angular components.

KSS Styleguide Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KSS (http://warpspire.com/kss/styleguides/) is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as Sass or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).

ES2015
~~~~~~
This project leverages new JavaScript features available in ES2015. Babel (https://babeljs.io/) is used to transpile the JavaScript.

Webpack
~~~~~~~
Webpack (https://webpack.github.io/) is a module bundler. It is used to produce static assets from modules with dependencies.
